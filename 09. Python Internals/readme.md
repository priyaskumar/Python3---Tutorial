_Python Internals_
==
- Python is an interpreted language.

- **Interpreter** : translates and executes program code line by line 

## _Versions of Python_:

- Cython :

    + Cython translates valid Python code directly to C in order to speed up the execution of the code (the resulting code in Python isn't always as efficient as if it were implemented in C)

    + Cython can run on Linux, MacOS and Windows aswell.

- Jython :
    + Jython is written in Java. 

    + Jython is not available for Python3, only available for Python2.

- RPython :
    + RPython is a subset of Python

    + Used by programmers who develop Python as it doesn't need an interpreter to run.
